# Tic Tac Toe Player Algorithm Challenge
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Player Algorithm Challenge! This challenge invites you to implement intelligent players in Python code to compete against other players' algorithms in the classic game of Tic Tac Toe.

# Challenge Overview
### Objective
Implement a Tic Tac Toe player algorithm in Python. Your algorithm should make intelligent moves to maximize the chances of winning the game or, at least, minimize the chances of losing.

## Rules
The game is played on a 3x3 board.
Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on an empty cell.
The first player to have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If the board is filled without a winner, the game is a draw.

Tic Tac Toe Player Algorithm Challenge
Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Player Algorithm Challenge! This challenge invites you to implement intelligent players in Python code to compete against other players' algorithms in the classic game of Tic Tac Toe.

Fork this repository.
Implement your Tic Tac Toe player algorithm in Python.
Document your approach and strategy within the code.
Submit a pull request with your implementation.


### Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-challenge.git
```
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
cd tic-tac-toe-challenge
```

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

```
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use
```

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install dependencies:

bash
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Implement your Tic Tac Toe player algorithm in the *players.py* file.

Test your player against other players by running the tournament.py script:

bash
Copy code
python tournament.py

## Submission Guidelines
Ensure your code is well-documented and includes comments explaining your strategy.
Include a brief description of your algorithm's approach in the pull request description.
Provide instructions on how to run your player in the README.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your player will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness of the implementation.
- Strategy and intelligence in making moves.
- Clarity and readability of the code.
- Documentation and comments explaining your approach.

## Additional Notes
- Feel free to explore various strategies and algorithms, such as minimax, alpha-beta pruning, or any other creative approach.
- Don't forget to test your player against different opponents to ensure its adaptability.

Good luck, and may the smartest Tic Tac Toe player prevail!
